# COMTEC ART 24/25

## Overview
**COMTEC ART 24/25** is a collaborative game development project created as part of a university program in Spain. The project brought together a diverse, international team of ten members â€” five developers and five designers â€” from across Europe and Asia, including Croatia, Korea, Spain, and Montenegro.

The result was a successful and well-received game, earning the highest grade in the course and gaining attention through Twitch streams during its presentation.
